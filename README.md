# midi-segmentizer

break a midi file into monophonic segments

## develop

`npm run start` to see if your code compiles. You can also go to localhost:8080 to see what the split will look like

`npm run test` - run tests once
`npm run test:dev` - run tests continuously
`npm run test:coverage` - see how well the tests cover the essential code

# MVP

* Monophonic tracks only

# todo

idea:

1. command line utility
2. has default process that splits (MVP)
3. has optional gui to allow you to edit
