# midi-segmentizer

React Component and/or helper functions to help you segment a piece of midi.

# todo

- this repo used to be somewhat coherent but now it's a bit all over the place... think about high level organization more
- determine output => experiement with midi, musicXML...

idea:

1. command line utility
2. has default process that splits (MVP)
3. has optional gui to allow you to edit
